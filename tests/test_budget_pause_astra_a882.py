"""Regression tests for the four Astra run-a882315dbcd7 findings closed in #1196
(commit 73d9c9a2): an orphaned durable Resume grant is revoked instead of
answering ``resume_already_granted`` forever; an unreadable custody chain is
``custody_read=failed``, never "no open runs"; a pending (START_REQUESTED,
unbound) invocation of THIS task is unknown custody; and a parallel tool batch
that leaves on ``UsageAccountingError`` waits for its already-started calls.

Fixtures come from the exact budget-pause suite (``tests/_budget_pause_exact_helpers``).
